Task 5
Create a calculator to work with rational numbers.
Requirements:
➢ It should provide capability to add, subtract, divide and multiply rational Numbers
➢ Create a method to compute GCD (this will come in handy during operations on rational)
    Add option to work with whole numbers which are also rational numbers i.e. (n/1)
➢ achieve the above using auxiliary constructors enable method overloading to enable each function to work with numbers and rational 

Task 6
